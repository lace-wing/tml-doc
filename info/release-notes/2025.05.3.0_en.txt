As always we are grateful for the massive amount of community participation in developing and testing new features each month.

This month's release contains several notable features that mod makers can look forward to using, such as loadout support for modded accessory slots new hooks for tile preview rendering. The full listing of changes is detailed below. Users can use a new chat command (/purgeunloaded) to remove unloaded tiles in worlds that are from mods they are no longer using. 

[b]Modders: [/b]There are several features of note currently in preview for next month that modders can test and provide feedback for. The most impactful change in preview this month relates to a large batch of fixes we've made to various vanilla sounds. These fixes should finish bringing all sounds to parity with vanilla behavior. These changes might influence existing mod logic as well, so be sure to test out sounds in your mods after reading the porting notes. We encourage mod makers to experiment with these new features on the preview branch and provide feedback this month so that they are ready for the stable release next month.
