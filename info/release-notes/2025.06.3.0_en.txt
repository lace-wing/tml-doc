Hello everyone! It is time for the August 2025 Stable Update. 

But first, some news. This last month we hosted our first official mod jam on our Discord server and it was a mind-blowing success. The theme was "Game Tribute" and we were impressed with how many high quality submissions we had. We thank everyone who participated and hope it was fun and a great practice! We encourage players to check out the mod jam submissions on the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=1281930&browsesort=trend&section=readytouseitems&requiredtags%5B0%5D=Mod+Jam+Entry&actualsort=trend&p=1&days=-1]workshop here[/url]. If you are interested in participating in the next mod jam, be sure to come to Discord and grab the "ModJam Ping" role to be notified.

Also, here is a collage of new mods released this past month. There were over 400 new mods this month! Have you tried any of these mods yet? Find any hidden gems?
