We are grateful for the massive amount of community participation in developing and testing new features each month.

This month's release contains various bug fixes and smaller features. We've fixed several regressions related to the liquid rendering fixes from last month and fixed some UI inconsistencies and errors. For modders, this month's release includes support for custom pressure plates along with new hooks for tile interactions, as well as new hooks for custom armor set shadow effects and transforming the full player rendering. 

[b]Modders:[/b] As usual, we'd like to encourage modders to test out new tModLoader features on the preview branch if they are relevant to your mod. Major features in preview are announced in the preview-update-log channel on our Discord. We encourage mod makers to experiment with these and other new features on the preview branch and provide feedback this month so that they are ready for the stable release next month.
