Title: April 2025 Stable Update

----------------------

Hello everyone! This last month tModLoader hit an exciting new player count record. We had 56,000 players playing at the same time! We look forward to even more users enjoying playing tModLoader as new mods continue to come out and existing mods continue to update.

It is time for the April 2025 Stable Update. 

A notable change for this month's release is the AddSpecialDraw changes for tile rendering. This can be used to address some animation frame rate and rendering issues of tiles with custom drawing code. We hope mod makers read the pull request description and apply the fixes to their own tiles if relevant. The full listing of changes is detailed below.

There are several features of note currently in preview for next month. One such feature is support for various biome conversion methods and classes. Another feature is greatly streamlined ModTileEntity code as well as a fully documented BasicTileEntity example. We encourage mod makers to experiment with these new features on the preview branch and provide feedback this month so that they are ready for the stable release next month.
