As always we are grateful for the massive amount of community participation in developing and testing new features each month.

This month's release contains new interaction options for NPC and projectiles, as well as a full rework of our code analyzer now called tModCodeAssist. The full listing of changes is detailed below.

[b]Modders:[/b] We'd like to encourage modders to experiment with the new ModAchievement feature that is currently available on the preview branch. We know modded achievements have been a highly requested feature for some time, so we are excited to see mods use them. We encourage mod makers to experiment with this and other new features on the preview branch and provide feedback this month so that they are ready for the stable release next month. 

As always, if you are having issues of any sort, definitely don't hesitate to check out our [url=https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Usage-FAQ]FAQ on GitHub[/url] or reach out to us at [url=https://discord.com/invite/tmodloader]our Discord[/url].
