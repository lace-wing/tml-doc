Hello everyone! We've hit another impressive milestone this month. The workshop now has over 10,000 mods available! That's amazing! Be sure to regularly check the workshop for newly released mods, we're positive you'll always find something fun and interesting to try out.

Each month hundreds of new mods are released, each a result of countless hours of work put into them by their creators. Here is a collage of the icons of most of the new mods released this last month alone.

It is time for the June 2025 Stable Update. 

We are once again grateful for the massive amount of community participation in developing and testing new features each month. Modders can look forward to new hooks and learning examples showcasing new capabilities. Some notable new features include a full custom ModType example in ExampleMod and new hooks for properly implementing custom equipment layers and draw flags. The full listing of changes is detailed below.

[b]Preview:[/b] There are several features of note currently in preview for next month that modders can test and provide feedback for. One new feature is equipment loadout support for ModAccessorySlot. We'd like to encourage modders to test this new feature so we know it is ready for release. Other features in preview include support for custom death messages for town NPC and bosses as well as support for clearing a world of tiles from unloaded mods. We encourage mod makers to experiment with these new features on the preview branch and provide feedback this month so that they are ready for the stable release next month.
